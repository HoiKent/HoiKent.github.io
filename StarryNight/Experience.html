    <p>It's interesting how much art and technology become increasingly connected. 
    <br>StarryNight is an example of how art and technology are working together and influencing one another. 
    <br>This art work can be compared to an algorithm. The posts that had the most clicks correlates to how big their star is. 
    <br>StarryNight collects data on how many times a text has been read,assigning a star to it on the project's “sky”.
    <br>Based on how many views the text receives, the star becomes bigger and brighter, 
    <br>This is can be used as a way to measure the importance or popularity of a specfic post.</p>

    <p>
        Another feature that is part of this art is selecting between the keywords linked to a specific star (text), 
        <br>linking it with the other texts having the same keyword in common. This is another example of how it can be comparable to an algorithm.
        <br>This feature is represented by a visual “linking” of stars. This creates constellations throughout the artwork.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the same way brighter stars are easier to get noticed in the sky by our eyes, 
    <br>theses specific texts that have more views are easier to be noticed by other internet users as well.
