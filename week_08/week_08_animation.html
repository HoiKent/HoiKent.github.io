        <section>
            <p class="disney"> Disney's 12 Principles of Animation allows animaters to create high-quality, believable, and entertaining animations. It helps them create characters and objects that move and behave in a natural and believable way.</p>
            <p class="disney1"> <b>Squash and Stretch</b> distorting an object to emphasize its weight and give it a more realistic feel. <b>Anticipation</b> prepares the audience for an action by showing a character's intent before the action is performed. <b>Staging</b> involves arranging characters and objects in a scene in a way that makes their actions and intentions clear to the audience. <b>Straight Ahead Action and Pose-to-Pose</b> These are two different approaches to creating animation. Straight ahead animation involves drawing each frame of an animation in sequence, while pose-to-pose animation involves creating key poses and then filling in the in-between frames. <b>Follow Through and Overlapping Action</b> they involve  adding extra movement to a character or object to make its actions more natural and fluid. <b>Slow In and Slow Out</b> means to easing into and out of an action to make it more realistic and smooth. The <b>Arcs</b> prociples nvolves using curved lines to create more natural movement in animation. <b>Secondary action</b> is adding another movement or animation to the character or object to express how they feel making the animation more complex and interesting. <b>Timing</b> is controlling the speed of an action. <b>Exaggeration</b> exagerating movement or action communicates the intetions and emotions to the audience better creating a entertaining animation. <b>Solid drawing</b> This principle involves creating characters and objects with a sense of weight, balance, and volume. <b>Appeal</b> involves creating characters and objects that are visually appealing and interesting to the audience.</p>
            <p class="disney"> The 12 principles help to establish a common language and understanding among animators. By fallowing them  animators can communicate more effectively with each other, beacuse they will know what the text step will be.</p>
