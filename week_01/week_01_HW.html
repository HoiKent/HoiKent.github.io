    <h2>As We May Think</h2>
        <p>It was interesting to read that Vannevar Bush was talking about a computer in its early stages of development and other types of technology such as screens, and cameras. As Vannevar bush was describing how the technology worked  it made me realize how far technology has come from their earlier versions and how small and efficient everything has become. Most of the content we consume are not stored locally anymore like how he described it, everything is now on the internet and we have the world knowledge at our fingertips, because information is so easily accessible we are faced with the problem of information overload. </p>
   <h2>Long Live The Web</h2>
        <p>We are living in an information revolution, and the internet is playing a massive role in it. The internet is an infinite piece of canvas that allows people to post whatever they want, sharing information and data is key to advancement in any field. Due to the capitalistic nature of the world, corporations deny people access to their research that would help to world evolve because they want to reap all the glory. This means that the possibility that an organization that is doing research on a problem might have been solved already by another company, and this is hindering human progress.</p>
